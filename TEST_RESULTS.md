## How to Run Tests

### Prerequisites
```bash
npm install
```

### Run Individual Test Suites
```bash
# Full comprehensive suite (file:// based, some CORS limitations)
npm test

# Upload-based testing (100% pass rate)
npm run test:upload

# End-to-end with HTTP server (100% pass rate)
npm run test:e2e

# Run both passing suites sequentially
npm run test:all
```

### Test Output
All tests provide detailed console output with:
- ✅ Pass/fail indicators
- Detailed error messages
- Browser console logs
- Final statistics and success rate

## Known Issues

1. **CORS on file:// URLs**: The full test suite shows 5 failures when running via file:// protocol due to sample.mp3 loading restrictions. This is expected and does not affect production usage via HTTP/HTTPS.

2. **Sample File Requirement**: Tests require `sample.mp3` to be present in the project root for audio processing tests.

## Conclusion
